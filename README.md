# Simple pet project for trying something not suitable yet for production

Based on default Vue + Vite TS starter, utilizing `Caddy` to serve SPA and deploy it on Railway:

tags:

- Node
- Vue3
- Vite
- TypeScript
- Caddy v2

---

## Local Development

- Install required dependencies with `npm install`
- Start the server for local development `npm run dev`
- Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/

## Why use `Caddy` when deploying to Railway?

Caddy is a powerful, enterprise-ready, open source web server, and therefore Caddy is far better suited to serve websites than Vite is, using Caddy will result in much less memory and cpu usage compared to serving with Vite (much lower running costs too)

To see how this is achieved with nixpacks, check out the fully documented nixpacks.toml file in this repository

The configuration for Caddy is called a Caddyfile, and you can edit that file to further suite your needs, by default it comes configured to serve a single page app for Vue 3, and to also gzip the responses
